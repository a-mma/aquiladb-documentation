## The BugHunter - do you like to test and push AquilaDB to its limits?
* [Install AquilaDB](https://aquiladb.xyz/docs/install-aquiladb) in your local system or cloud and [play around](https://aquiladb.xyz/docs/get-started) with it. If you find any bugs wandering freely around our planet, [report and label it as a bug immediately](https://github.com/a-mma/AquilaDB/issues/new/choose). Roger!
* You can also check the [reported bugs](https://github.com/a-mma/AquilaDB/labels/bug) by other BugHunters and help them to add more information if you feel like it's incomplete. You can also try reproducing the bug by following the steps mentioned and confirm it's a real threat to our planet.
* Eventually, you will get to know how the code works and if you think you could fix a bug (killing is bad), feel free to take a deep breath and fix it. Don't forget to fork it before you do so and once you fix it, [create a pull request](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md).
* Keep discussions rolling. If a bug report takes too much time to get fixed, roll up your sleeve keep the discussion moving towards the goal.

## The CiphCracker - interested in improving the documentation?
* [Read the documentation](https://aquiladb.xyz/docs/introduction) and make sure your brain could comprehend it. If not, it's not your fault but because it's not well written. Free the hunger for knowledge in you to [ask for clarification](https://github.com/a-mma/aquiladb-documentation/issues) and once you understand it, modify that part of the documentation. Submit modifications as [a pull request](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)
* Add more creative examples of AquilaDb to the [tutirial part of documentation](https://aquiladb.xyz/docs/get-started).

* Add illustrations to the documentation to make it more expressive of the point.

## The Mentor - would you like to onboard newbies to AquilaDB?

* Add more [How-To guides on AquilaDB official documentation](https://aquiladb.xyz/docs/install-aquiladb) and [official blog](https://medium.com/a-mma).

## The Artist - creativity and visual storytelling your thing?
